Hello Alexey, There are two types of scholarships offered to a selected few of the non EU candidates. Category 1 – which includes a tution fee waiver, a one-time mobility support package and a monthly allowance. Category 2 – which includes a tuition fee waiver and a one-time mobility support package. Only approximately 40% of the students who applied were admitted and out of them only half of them were offered some type of scholarship. It is very unlikely that you will be offered additional financial support from EIT ICT Labs, but naturally you are most welcome to apply for funding from other sources as well. Best wishes, Jenny Lundin
